## What is FinFlow?

FinFlow is a full-stack finance management platform designed for **freelancers and small business owners** who need a simple, powerful way to manage their income and expenses — without the complexity of enterprise accounting software.

The core problem it solves: freelancers often track invoices in spreadsheets, miss payment follow-ups, and have no clear picture of their monthly revenue vs. spending. FinFlow brings all of that into one clean, fast, AI-assisted web application.

**Key differentiator:** A built-in AI assistant (powered by Google Gemini) that understands a plain-English project description and automatically generates a professional invoice — title, description, and itemised line items — in one click.

## Features

### Invoice Management
- Create invoices with multiple line items, quantity, rate, and automatic total calculation
- Apply configurable tax rates per invoice
- Track invoice lifecycle: **Draft → Sent → Paid / Overdue**
- Quick status updates directly from the invoice detail view
- Auto-generated unique invoice numbers (e.g. `INV-849302`)
- Full edit and delete support

### Client Management
- Maintain a client directory with name, email, phone, company, and address
- Client data is scoped to the logged-in user — no data leakage between accounts
- Card-based UI with instant search and inline edit/delete

### Expense Tracking
- Log business expenses with title, amount, date, and category
- Seven categories: Tools, Marketing, Utilities, Travel, Food, Office, Other
- Filter by category and search by title
- Running total visible at all times

### Dashboard & Analytics
- **4 stats cards:** Total Revenue, Pending Amount, Overdue Amount, Total Expenses
- **6-month area chart** comparing revenue (paid invoices) vs. expenses month-by-month
- **Recent invoices** panel with direct navigation to each
- **Quick count tiles** for All / Paid / Sent / Overdue invoices

### AI Invoice Generation (Gemini)
- Describe a project in plain English (e.g. *"Logo design for a bakery"*)
- One click calls the Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- AI returns structured JSON: invoice title, professional description, and 2–4 suggested line items with realistic INR rates
- Results are pre-filled into the form — user reviews and submits

### Authentication & Security
- Email/password registration with bcrypt hashing (12 salt rounds)
- JWT issued on login, stored in an **httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie** — immune to XSS token theft
- 7-day token expiry
- Route-level auth guard (`proxy.ts`) redirects unauthenticated requests server-side
- All API routes verify the JWT before touching the database
- Every database query scopes by `userId` — users can never access each other's data
- Server-side input validation with Zod v4 on all POST/PUT endpoints

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | SSR, API routes, and UI in one project; no Express needed |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | End-to-end type safety from DB models to UI props |
| Database | MongoDB + Mongoose 8 | Flexible document model suits invoice/expense shapes well |
| Auth | JWT + httpOnly cookies | Stateless, secure, works without a session store |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first; consistent design system, no CSS files |
| Charts | Recharts | Composable React chart components, minimal bundle cost |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod v4 | Uncontrolled forms for perf; Zod for runtime validation |
| AI | Google Gemini 1.5 Flash | Fast, free-tier available, structured JSON output |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB database (free tier on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- A Gemini API key (free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koyalmohadikar/invoice-manager.git
cd invoice-manager
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/invoice-manager
JWT_SECRET=a-long-random-secret-string-change-this
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-from-google-ai-studio
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Run the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — sign up for a new account and you're in.

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for **zero-config Vercel deployment**:

1. Push to a GitHub repository
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add the three environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) in Vercel project settings
4. Deploy — every push to `main` triggers an automatic redeploy (CI/CD)

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret key for signing JWTs — use a long random string in production |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | No | Google AI Studio key — AI feature is disabled gracefully without it |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | No | Base URL (used for metadata) |

---

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt (12 rounds)** before storage
- JWTs are stored in **httpOnly cookies** — not accessible from JavaScript
- All mutations validate and sanitise input with **Zod v4 schemas** server-side
- Database queries always filter by `userId` — enforcing **row-level isolation**
- `JWT_SECRET` and `MONGODB_URI` are server-only env vars (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- The AI endpoint validates input length and returns a safe 503 if the API key is missing
